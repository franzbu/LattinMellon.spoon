# üí´ LattinMellon

It should be stressed that this tool is not for everybody and certainly not for the average user. Only go for it if you are accustomed to or at the very least interested in using your mouse less and your keyboard more in order to get things done more efficiently.

On macOS, there is a variety of tools for resizing and moving windows getting the keyboard involved, saving the time of having to time-consumingly grab onto edges or corners of windows. However, none of these tools have satisfied me, partly for the lack of fluency and mostly for functional limitations. 

The tool SkyRocket by dbalatero I have come accross, which uses a transparent canvas for addressing the already mentioned lack of fluency many tools are hampered with, provides a solid foundation. Two things left me wanting, though. The first was the limitation of balatero's tool to resize windows only down/right. Second, the idea of using an additional canvas solved the problem regarding the lack of fluency, but when moving or reducing the size of a window, the canvas prevents precise window positioning.

I started with a fork of dblatero's SkyRocket with the aim of resolving the first limitation; windows can now be resized all directions; this tool can be found in this very repository.

Eventually, the limitations of having to cope a canvas led to the development of a new tool, LattinMellon.

Besides moving and resizing windows by placing the cursor in any part of them, LattinMellon can also be used for automatic positioning and resizing of windows with a simple flick of the mouse. You best try it out; its intuitive approach is mostly self-explanatory.

The animated GIFs below don't capture the mouse cursor correctly; in real life the cursor moves along with moving and resizing the window as expected. Nevertheless, the animations still give you an idea of how this tool works.

## Installation

This tool requires [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) to be installed and running.

To install LattinMellon, after downloading and unzipping, move the folder to ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons and make sure the name of the folder is 'LattinMellon.spoon'. 

Alternatively, you can simply paste the following line into a terminal window and execute it:

```lua

mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons && git clone https://github.com/franzbu/LattinMellon.spoon.git ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/LattinMellon.spoon

```

## Usage

Once you've installed LattinMellon, add this to your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` file:

```lua
local LattinMellon = hs.loadSpoon("LattinMellon")

LattinMellon:new({
  -- How much space (in percent) in the middle of each of the four window-margins do you want to reserve for limiting
  -- resizing windows to horizontally and vertically? 0 disables this function, 100 disables diagonal resizing:
  margin = 30,

  -- modifier(s) to hold to move (left mouse button) or resize (right mouse button) a window:
  moveAndResizeModifier = { 'alt' },

  -- modifiers for additional features:
  OMmodifier = { 'alt', 'ctrl' }, -- 'shift',
  TATmodifier = { 'alt', 'ctrl', 'cmd' }, -- 'ctrl',
  SATmodifier = { 'alt', 'ctrl', 'cmd', 'shift' }, -- hyper key
})
```

### Manual Moving

To move a window, hold your `moveModifiers` or any higher level modifier key(s) down, then click `moveMouseButton` and drag the window. If a window is dragged up to 10 percent of its width (left and right borders of screen) or its height (bottom border) outside the screen borders, it will automatically snap back within the limits of the screen. If the window is dragged beyond that 10-percent-limit, things start to get interesting because then automatic resizing and positioning come into play - more about that in a minute.


### Manual Resizing

To manually resize a window, hold your `resizeModifiers` or any higher level modifier key(s) down, then click `resizeMouseButton` in any part of the window and drag the window. If a window is resized beyond the borders of the screen, it will automatically snap back within the limits of the screen.

To have the additional possibility to precisely resize windows horizontally-only and vertically-only, the option 'margin' has to be set to a value higher than '0'. '30', for example, signifies that 30 percent of the window (15 precent left and right of the middle of each border) is reserved for horizontal-only and vertical-only resizing.


```lua
 +---+---+---+
 | ‚Üñ | ‚Üë | ‚Üó |
 +---+---+---+
 | ‚Üê | M | ‚Üí |
 +---+---+---+
 | ‚Üô | ‚Üì | ‚Üò |
 +---+---+---+
```

At the very center of the window there is an erea (M), the size of which depends on the size of the just described margin for horizontal-only and vertical-only resizing. In the M-part of a window, you can also move the latter by pressing the resizeMouseButton. If 'margin' in 'init.lua' is set to 0, the 'M' area is disabled alongside with the horizontal-only and vertical-only resizing.


### Automatic Positioning and Resizing

For automatic resizing and positioning of a window, you simply have to move 10 percent or more of the window beyond the left, right, or bottom borders of the screen. Depending on the grid size set in 'init.lua', the window snaps into the according position and size. As has been mentioned, windows can be moved with the `moveModifiers`, `resizeModifiers` (with your cursor in the middle of the window), or any of the higher level modifiers. 

As long as windows are resized, or moved within the borders of the screen, it makes no difference which one of the various modifier keys (resizeModifiers, moveModifiers, modifierLayerTwo, modifierLayerThree, modifierLayerFour) is used. However, once a window is moved beyond the screen borders (10 or more percent of the window), different positioning and resizing scenarios are called into action; they are as follows:

* Layer one (moveModifier, resizeModifier):
  * If windows are moved past the left/right borders of the screen: depending on the size of the grid (gridX, gridY) established in 'init.lua', windows snap into the corresponding grid position in the first/last column of the screen. The vertical grid position correlates with the position of the cursor when moving the window beyond the screen border.
  * If windows are moved past the bottom border of the screen: windows snap into full height; width corresponds to the size of the grid (one grid column).

* Layer two:
  * left/right: windows snap into second/penultimate column of the screen.
  * bottom: windows snap into full height; width is two grid columns.
 
* Layer three:
  * left/right: windows snap into 2x2 grid, aligned to the grid cell where the cursor is moved beyond the screen border.
  * bottom: window snaps into width of a grid column and in terms of height the bottom half of the size of the screen.
 
* Layer four:
  * left/right: imagine the screen border divided into three equally long parts: if the cursor crosses the screen border in the middle third, the window snaps into the left/right half of the screen. Crossing the screen border in the upper and lower thirds the window snaps into the respective quarters of the screen.
  * bottom: windows snap into the width of one grid element and the top half of the height of the screen.


### Disabling moving/resizing for certain applications

You can disable move/resize for any application by adding it to the `disabledApps` option:

```lua
LattinMellon:new({
  -- How much space (in percent) in the middle of each of the four window-margins do you want to reserve for limiting 
  -- resizing windows to horizontally and vertically? 0 disables this function, 100 disables diagonal resizing.
  margin = 30,

  -- ...

  -- Applications that cannot be resized:
  disabledApps = {"Alacritty"},
})
```
